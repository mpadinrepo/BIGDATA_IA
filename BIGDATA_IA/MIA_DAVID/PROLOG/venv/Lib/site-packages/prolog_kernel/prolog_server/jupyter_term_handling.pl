% This module provides predicates to handle terms received from the client, compute their results and assert them with term_response/1.
% There are three main types of terms.
% For each of the types there are terms which need to be handled specially.
% The following types of terms are differentiated:
% - directives:
%   - begin_tests/1
%   - begin_tests/2
%   - end_tests/1
%   - any other directive
% - clause definitions:
%   - test(Name) :- Body
%   - test(Name, Options) :- Body
%   - Head :- Body
%   - Head --> Body
%   - Head (if the request contains more than one term)
% - queries (including terms following '?-'):
%   - retry or jupyter:retry
%   - cut or jupyter:cut
%   - halt or jupyter:halt
%   - a call of a special jupyter predicate:
%     - jupyter:print_table/1 or jupyter:print_table/2
%     - jupyter:print_sld_tree/1
%     - jupyter:print_transition_graph/1,3,4
%     - jupyter:show_graph/2  % alternative name for print_transition_graph with Node and Edge predicate
%     - jupyter:set_prolog_impl/1
%     - jupyter:update_completion_data/0
%     - jupyter:print_stack/0
%   - a call of run_tests: run_tests/0, run_tests/1 or run_tests/2
%   - a call of trace: trace/0, trace/1 or trace/2
%   - a call of leash/1
%   - a call of abolish/1 or abolish/2(in case of SICStus Prolog)
%   - any other term which is the only one of a request

% Furthermore, a retry is not possible and a directive's variable bindings are not sent to the client.

% Therefore, all declarations of a request are written to a file which is loaded.

% The declaration file is loaded when all terms of a request have been handled.
% When declaring a property of a predicate for which clauses had been asserted before, these do not exist anymore after the declaration.
% Therefore, a cell declaring predicate properties cannot contain clauses for the same predicate.

% Print SLD Trees

% Create content for a file representing a graph resembling the SLD tree of an execution that can be rendered with DOT.
% The collection of the data needs to be handled differntly for SWI- and SICStus Prolog:
% - SICStus: a breakpoint which is removed after the execution.
% - SWI: user:prolog_trace_interception/4 is used that calls assert_sld_data/4 which succeeds if SLD data is to be collected (if a clause collect_sld_data/0 exists).

% So far, data is collected for call ports only and no leaves are shown marking a successful or failing branch.
% In order to add such leaves, data needs to be collected for other ports as well.
% Then, to add a failure/success leaf, the first fail/exit port for a call needs to be determined.

% The graph file content is created like the following.
% Nodes are defined by their ID and labelled with the goal.
% Directed edges are added from a parent invocation to the child invocation.
% This may look like the following:
%   digraph {
%       "4" [label="app([1,2],[3],A)"]
%       "5" [label="app([2],[3],B)"]
